    <p>Hello! My name is Joel Haro, and I am from Trujillo, Perú, known as the "City of Eternal Spring".</p>
    <p>
      I have decided to pursue and focus on earning a Bachelor's degree in
      <strong>Software Development</strong>. I have always been passionate about computers and
      all aspects of technology. In addition to my interest in tech, I enjoy
      playing the piano, playing soccer, and swimming.

    <p>Perú is a country in South America that's home to a section of Amazon rainforest and Machu Picchu, an ancient
      Incan city high in the Andes mountains. The region around Machu Picchu, including the Sacred Valley, Inca Trail
      and colonial city of Cusco, is rich in archaeological sites. On Peru’s arid Pacific coast is Lima, the capital,
      with a preserved colonial center and important collections of pre-Columbian art.</p>
