    <p>Hello! My name is Joel Haro, and I am from Trujillo, Perú, known as the "City of Eternal Spring".</p>
    <p>
      I have decided to pursue and focus on earning a Bachelor's degree in
      <strong>Software Development</strong>. I have always been passionate about computers and
      all aspects of technology. In addition to my interest in tech, I enjoy
      playing the piano, playing soccer, and swimming.
